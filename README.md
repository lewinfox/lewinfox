## Hi there 👋 🦊

I'm a data engineer based in Wellington, New Zealand. I mostly write R and Python but have dabbled in a few different
things over the years. 


### Stuff I made

I maintain some open source projects:

* 🍦 [icecream](https://lewinfox.github.io/icecream), an R package which makes print debugging a little sweeter.
* 🛸 [levitate](https://lewinfox.github.io/levitate), a fuzzy string comparison library for R.
* 🕸️ [foodwebr](https://lewinfox.github.io/foodwebr), an R package for drawing function dependency graphs.
  
Please try them out! If you want to contribute code or feedback that would be awesome ⭐


### Stuff I'm learning

- 🌱 I’m currently learning [`dbt`](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt) and Snowflake for my work with 
  [New Zealand Post](https://github.com/nzpost)!
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with [R language internals](https://www.github.com/lewinfox/foodwebr/issues/).


### Stuff I write

I sometimes blog at [lewinfox.com](https://www.lewinfox.com).
