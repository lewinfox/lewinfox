## Hi there 👋 🦊

I'm a data engineer based in Wellington, New Zealand. I mostly write R and Python but have dabbled in a few different
things over the years. 


### Stuff I made

I maintain some open source R packages:

* 🍦 [icecream](https://lewinfox.com/icecream) makes print debugging a little sweeter.
* 🛸 [levitate](https://lewinfox.com/levitate) does fuzzy string comparison.
* 🕸️ [foodwebr](https://lewinfox.com/foodwebr) draws function dependency graphs.
* &#955; [lambdar](https://lewinfox.com/lambdar) helps you run R on AWS Lambda.
  
Please try them out! If you want to contribute code or feedback that would be awesome ⭐


### Stuff I'm learning

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with [R language internals](https://www.github.com/lewinfox/foodwebr/issues/).


### Stuff I write

I sometimes blog at [lewinfox.com](https://www.lewinfox.com).
